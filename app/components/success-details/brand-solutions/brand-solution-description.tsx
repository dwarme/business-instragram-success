                  Reserved was already using Advantage+ catalogue ads on
                  Instagram, relying on ads in carousel format to display items
                  from its large inventory of products. Advantage+ catalogue ads
                  automatically show the right products to people who have
                  expressed interest on a company’s website, app or elsewhere on
                  the internet. Companies simply upload their product catalogue
                  and set up their campaign, and it will continue working –
                  showing people the most appropriate products, with up-to-date
                  pricing and availability.

                  Reserved decided to add tags to the products that featured on
                  their ads. Ads with product tags can encourage people to visit
                  a product details page, where they can then shop for products
                  from the ad. Businesses that use checkout on Instagram can
                  enable checkout for a campaign to give shoppers the ability to
                  purchase from the business`&apos;`s website or directly
                  in-app.
                </p>

                <p className="_4971">
                  To test the new approach, Reserved used a conversion lift test
                  to measure its usual campaign of ads in carousel format
                  against an identical campaign with product tags added. The
                  difference in ad creative was subtle, but its effect was
                  remarkable. Between September 28–October 12, 2022, the
                  campaign achieved:

                    83% lower cost per incremental purchase with product tags
                    added
                  </li>
                  <li className="_8-d2">
                    6X more incremental conversions with product tags added
                  </li>
                  <li className="_8-d2">
                    6.1X higher incremental return on ad spend with product tags
                    added
                  </li>
